## Use of AI
# For Battleship.py
I used AI to help me understand and work through the logic of how to write what i wanted, but I wrote all lines myself!

# For tests
I used AI to generate the tests. For that, it created the Battleship_AI.py to change the original file to have classes and functions that would allow it to actually run the tests.
