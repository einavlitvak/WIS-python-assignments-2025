I thought it would be easier to not open the actual issues, to avoid confusion for them. But I took to projects and these are the issues I would have opened to each of them:

Amino acid structure game (Avigail Yariv)
Hi Avigail. Your game is really cool and useful! I thought of some minor improvements for it, after trying it a few times:
- I would add maybe that it can reconize some typos. like i wrote 'tirosine' instead of 'tyrosine', and it didn't accept it at all even though I was on the right track... it could have a feature of accepting a result (maybe as half a point) but letting you know you have a typo.
- for people that have no previous knowledge, maybe have a list pop up with all the aa names 
- the score goes to negative. is that intentional? 

birthday_soon_to_be (Yana Lerner)
Hi Yana! Cute idea!! I thought the GUI was really cute and loved the little animations :). 
- I found a few typos while reading the readme so then i asked AI to find all typos in the file and this was the output:
Line 2: "virsions" → "versions" (appears twice)
Line 2: "extanstions" → "extensions"
Line 2: "needead" → "needed"
Line 2: "virsion" → "version"
Line 10: "calculte" → "calculate"
Line 10: "weaks" → "weeks"
Line 13: "fell" → "feel"
Line 16: "confussed" → "confused"
Line 16: "becuse" → "because"
Line 22: "But I know we can't pip install becuse we use UV" → "because"
Line 28: "virtul" → "virtual"
Line 65: "ttkrhemes" → "ttkthemes"
Line 72: "dosen't" → "doesn't"
Line 72: "extantions" → "extensions"
Line 72: "virsions" → "versions"
- issue with how its calculating the time until birthday, I typed in a birthday and the calculation wasnt correct. 
I asked AI to explain what the issue with code is and it wrote: 
I see the problem. The calculation uses total_days // 30 which is a rough approximation. For a birthday on June 4th when today is December 6th, the next birthday is June 4, 2026 - which is exactly 6 months and 2 days away (Dec has 31 days, so 25 days left in Dec + Jan 31 + Feb 28/29 + Mar 31 + Apr 30 + May 31 + 4 days in June = 179-180 days, which divided by 30 gives ~5.9 months).
- I'm running on Linux and apparnetly the code is implementing some emojis next to the title that dont render well for linux. Maybe that could be considered
