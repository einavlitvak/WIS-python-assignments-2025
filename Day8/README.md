# Spotify Data Analysis
I took the .CSV file from kaggle, it was not very good because there was no variability in the plots
This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify songs to uncover trends related to popularity, country, genre, and audio features.

## Analyses

1.  **Explicit Songs vs. Country**
    Plots the total count of explicit songs for each country. Includes a linear regression line to show the trend, along with the R² value (correlation strength) and p-value (statistical significance).

2.  **Average Release Year by Country**
    Shows the average release year of songs for each country, indicating if some countries have more recent tracks in the dataset than others.

3.  **Genre Popularity**
    Ranks musical genres based on their average popularity score to identify which genres are currently trending.

4.  **Tempo Trends Over Time**
    Tracks the average tempo (BPM) of songs released over the years to see if music is getting faster or slower.

5.  **Explicit vs. Popularity**
    Compares the average popularity of explicit songs versus non-explicit songs to see if explicit content correlates with higher popularity.

6.  **Country Danceability**
    Ranks countries based on the average "danceability" score of the songs popular in that region.
